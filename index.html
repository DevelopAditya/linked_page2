<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>This crisis in the economy, polity and society formed the background 
to Hitlers rise to power. Born in 1889 in Austria, Hitler spent his youth in poverty. When the First World War broke
out, he enrolled for the army, acted as a messenger in the front, became a corporal, and earned medals for bravery. 
The German defeat horrified him and the Versailles Treaty made him furious. In 1919, he joined a small group called 
the German Workers Party. He subsequently took over the organisation and renamed it the National Socialist German 
Workers Party. This party came to be known as the Nazi Party.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>In 1923, Hitler planned to seize control of Bavaria, march to Berlin and
capture power. He failed, was arrested, tried for treason, and later released. The Nazis could not effectively mobilise
popular support till the early 1930s. It was during the Great Depression that Nazism became a mass movement. As we have 
seen, after 1929, banks collapsed and businesses shut down, workers lost their jobs and the middle classes were threatened 
with destitution. In such a situation Nazi propaganda stirred hopes of a better future. In 1928, the Nazi Party got no more 
than 2. 6 per cent votes in the Reichstag  the German parliament. By 1932, it had become the largest party with 37 per cent 
votes.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Hitler was a powerful speaker. His passion and his words moved people. He 
promised to build a strong nation, undo the injustice of the Versailles Treaty and restore the dignity of the German people. 
He promised employment for those looking for work, and a secure future for the youth. He promised to weed out all foreign 
influences and resist all foreign conspiracies against Germany.</p></font></br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Hitler devised a new style of politics. He understood the significance of rituals 
and spectacle in mass mobilisation. Nazis held massive ralliesand public meetings to demonstrate the support for Hitler and 
instil a sense of unity among the people. The Red banners with the Swastika, the Nazi salute, and the ritualised rounds of 
applause after the speeches were all part of this spectacle of power.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Nazi propaganda skilfully projected Hitler as a messiah, a saviour, as someone 
who had arrived to deliver people from their distress. It is an image that captured the imagination of a people whose sense 
of dignity and pride had been shattered, and who were living in a time of acute economic and political crises.</p></font><br><br>
<font color="red"><i><u><h2>The Destruction of Democracy</h2></u></i></font><br>
<img src="image4.jpg" hiegth=400 width=450 align=left>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>On 30 January 1933, President Hindenburg offered the Chancellorship, the highest 
position in the cabinet of ministers, to Hitler. By now the Nazis had  managed to rally the conservatives to their cause. Having 
acquired power, Hitler set out to dismantle the structures of democratic rule. A mysterious fire that broke out in the German 
Parliament building in February facilitated his move. The Fire Decree of 28 February 1933 indefinitely suspended civic rights 
like freedom of speech, press and assembly that had been guaranteed by the Weimar constitution. Then he turned on his archenemies, 
the Communists, most of whom were hurriedly packed off to the newly established concentration camps. The repression of the Communists 
was severe. Out of the surviving 6,808 arrest files of Duesseldorf, a small city of half a million population, 1,440 were those of 
Communists alone. They were, however, only one among the 52 types of victims persecuted by the Nazis across the country.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>On 3 March 1933, the famous Enabling Act was passed. This Act established dictatorship in 
Germany. It gave Hitler all powers to sideline Parliament and rule by decree. All political parties and trade unions were banned except 
for the Nazi Party and its affiliates. The state established complete control over the economy, media, army and judiciary.</p></font><br> 
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Special surveillance and security forces were created to control and order society in ways 
that the Nazis wanted.  Apart from the already existing regular police in green uniform and the SA or the Storm Troopers, these included 
the Gestapo (secret state police), the SS (the protection squads), criminal police and the Security Service (SD). It was the extra-constitutional 
powers of these newly organised forces that gave the Nazi state its reputation as the most dreaded criminal state. People could now be detained 
in Gestapo torture chambers, rounded up and sent to concentration camps, deported at will or arrested without any legal procedures. 
The police forces acquired powers to rule with impunity.</p></font><br><br>
<font color="red"><i><u><h2>Reconstruction</h2></u></i></font><br>
<img src="image3.jpg" hiegth=400 width=450 align=right>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Hitler assigned the responsibility of economic recovery to the economist Hjalmar Schacht who 
aimed at full production and full employment through a state-funded work-creation programme. This project produced the famous German 
superhighways and the peoples car, the Volkswagen.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>In foreign policy also Hitler acquired quick successes. He pulled out of the League of Nations 
in 1933, reoccupied the Rhineland in 1936, and integrated Austria and Germany in 1938 under the slogan, One people, One empire, and One 
leader. He then went on to wrest Germanspeaking Sudentenland from Czechoslovakia, and gobbled up the entire country. In all of this he had 
the unspoken support of England, which had considered the Versailles verdict too harsh. These quick successes at home and abroad seemed to 
reverse the destiny of the country.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Hitler did not stop here. Schacht had advised Hitler against investing hugely in rearmament as 
the state still ran on deficit financing. Cautious people, however, had no place in Nazi Germany. Schacht had to leave. Hitler chose war as 
the way out of the approaching economic crisis. Resources were to be accumulated through expansion of territory.  In September 1939, Germany 
invaded Poland. This started a war with France and England. In September 1940, a Tripartite Pact was signed between Germany, Italy and Japan, 
strengthening Hitlers claim to international power. Puppet regimes, supportive of Nazi Germany, were installed in a large part of Europe. 
By the end of 1940, Hitler was at the pinnacle of his power.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Hitler now moved to achieve his long-term aim of conquering Eastern Europe. He wanted to ensure 
food supplies and living space for Germans.  He attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941. In this historic blunder Hitler exposed the German western 
front to British aerial bombing and the eastern front to the powerful Soviet armies. The Soviet Red Army inflicted a crushing and humiliating 
defeat on Germany at Stalingrad.  After this the Soviet Red Army hounded out the retreating German soldiers until they reached the heart of Berlin, 
establishing Soviet hegemony over the entire Eastern Europe for half a century thereafter.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Meanwhile, the USA had resisted involvement in the war. It was unwilling to once again face all the 
economic problems that the First World War had caused. But it could not stay out of the war for long. Japan was expanding its power in the east. 
It had occupied French Indo-China and was planning attacks on US naval bases in the Pacific. When Japan extended its support to Hitler and bombed 
the US base at Pearl Harbor, the US entered the Second World War. The war ended in May 1945 with Hitlers defeat and the US dropping of the atom 
bomb on Hiroshima in Japan.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>From this brief account of what happened in the Second World War, we now return to Helmuth and his 
fathers story, a story of Nazi criminality during the war.</p></font><br>
